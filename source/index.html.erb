  <h1>Discovery</h1>
    <p>
      Before we write one line of code, we want to get to know your product and its users.
    </p>
    <p>
      We will meet with you, brainstorm ideas, and sketch them out together to figure out
      where to begin.

  <h1>Wireframing</h1>
    <p>
      We'll help solidify your ideas by creating wireframes for your project.
    </p>
    <p>
      This stage allows us to explore all of our options quickly, focusing
      only on layout and usability, so that we get feedback as early as possible.

  <h1>Prototyping</h1>
    <p>
      The next phase in our process is building a static prototype. Based on our
      wireframes, we'll start structuring things in the browser using HTML and CSS.
    </p>
    <p>
      This allows the developers on the team to start implementing functionality
      with the design earlier in the process.

  <h1>User Testing</h1>
    <p>
      Light user testing is done throughout the design and development process.
      It can be done after wireframing, prototyping, or implementation.
    </p>
    <p>
      We feel that the earlier and more often user testing is done, the
      better your application will be in the end.

  <h1>Visual Design</h1>
    <p>
      The visual design process is one of the most exciting steps.
      It's the time when we begin layering in color, texture and perfect the
      use of typography.
    </p>
    <p>
      Because we care about every little detail, we spend a lot of time
      perfecting and polishing the entire application.
    </p>
    <div class="points-box blue-bg cf">
      <div class="clock"></div>
      <p>Visual Design takes 2 to 3 weeks.</p>

  <div class="column half">
  <h1>Implementation</h1>
    <p>
      Depending on your project's timeline, we can go from wireframes
      to implementation. We'll provide recommendations, wireframe and
      go right into implementing the design.
    </p>
    <p>
      We understand time and budget constraints and are here to help
      you craft a product that you can be proud ofâ€”that your users
      will fall in love with.
